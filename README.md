# Task_5

# Titanic Dataset EDA - Data Analyst Internship Task 5

## Objective
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to extract insights using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Dataset
- [train.csv](./train.csv) from the Kaggle Titanic Competition.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Google Colab

## Steps Performed
1. Data Loading and Initial Exploration
2. Handling Missing Values
3. Univariate Analysis (Distribution of features)
4. Bivariate Analysis (Relationships between features)
5. Multivariate Analysis (Interacting multiple features)
6. Observations and Final Summary

## Key Insights
- Females had a higher survival rate than males.
- First-Class passengers survived more than Second and Third-Class.
- Higher fare and younger age were linked to better survival chances.
- Most passengers boarded from port 'S' (Southampton).

## Deliverables
- `Titanic_EDA_Task5.ipynb` — Jupyter Notebook with code and visualizations.
- `Titanic_EDA_Report.pdf` — PDF Report summarizing the EDA findings.
- train_csv dataset
